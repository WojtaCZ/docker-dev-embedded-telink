# Smoke test for docker-dev-embedded-telink. Runs INSIDE the built image.
#
# The Telink SDK is EULA-restricted and cannot be in CI, so this cannot
# cross-compile. What it CAN prove is that the image builds at all (the previous
# Dockerfile referenced four packages that do not exist), that the 32-bit
# runtime the tc32 blob needs is present, and that the SDK-absent path fails
# with a clear message instead of a confusing one.
